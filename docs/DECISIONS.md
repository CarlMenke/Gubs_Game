# Design & Engineering Decisions

Running log. Newest phase last. Each entry: what was decided, and why.

---

## D-001 — Engine: Godot 4.7.2 stable, GDScript, Forward+
The user has `Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64` locally, so the project pins that version.
GDScript over C# to keep the toolchain to a single dependency (no .NET SDK required to
build). Forward+ renderer because the map leans on volumetric fog, many small dynamic
torch lights, and SDFGI/SSAO — all Forward+-only or Forward+-preferred features.

## D-002 — World scale: 1 unit = 1 metre
The Stylized Nature MegaKit is authored at roughly human scale (a common tree is ~7 m
tall, tall grass ~1.8 m). The supplied `Gub.glb` is 5.18 units tall in bind pose, so the
Gub is imported at **0.35 scale** → ~1.81 m. Spear (1.90 units) is scaled to ~0.75 →
1.42 m. This lets us use realistic gravity and jump tuning without fighting the kit.

## D-003 — Source meshes are decimated offline
Every supplied `.glb` (`Gub`, `Spear`, `Lure`, `Mushroom/base_*`) is a ~500,000-triangle
photogrammetry-style mesh with a 4K texture. Eight networked Gubs plus spears, deployed
mushrooms and lures would be 5M+ triangles per frame before shadows — untenable.

`tools/decimate_assets.py` performs quadric-error decimation (`fast_simplification`) and
re-attaches UVs, skin joints and weights by nearest-source-vertex transfer, then rewrites
a clean `.glb` into `art/generated/`. Sources in `assets/` are never modified — the
pipeline is re-runnable and the raw art stays pristine.

Targets: Gub 18k tris (skinned, drawn up to 8× plus shadows), Spear 4k, Lure 6k,
Mushroom 12k.

## D-004 — Networking: ENet, host-authoritative, host also plays
Godot's high-level multiplayer over ENet. The host runs the authoritative match state
(scores, kills, spawns, projectile simulation) and also plays. This is the right shape for
a casual 2–8 player party game: no dedicated server to operate, no matchmaking backend.

Split of authority:
- **Client-authoritative**: its own Gub's position/rotation/animation (replicated via
  `MultiplayerSynchronizer`). Cheating a position in a friends-only party game is an
  acceptable trade for eliminating prediction/reconciliation complexity.
- **Server-authoritative**: throwing (client sends an *intent* RPC), all projectile
  simulation, hit resolution, deaths, respawns, scoring, match phase, and timers.

## D-005 — Invite codes encode the host endpoint
The user asked for "click invite, get a key, anyone with the key can join". Doing that
across the internet with no fixed address normally needs a signalling/relay server, which
means infrastructure to run and pay for. Instead the invite code is a **Crockford-base32
encoding of the host's IPv4 address + port**, formatted `XXXX-XXXX-XX`.

This is real and works today over LAN, over a VPN (Tailscale/Hamachi/Radmin), or over the
internet with one forwarded port — and it needs zero backend. The code is opaque enough to
feel like a lobby key while remaining a pure client-to-client dial.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` records the seam where a relay/signalling transport would slot in
later without touching game code (`Net` exposes `host()`/`join()` against an
abstract `MultiplayerPeer`).

## D-006 — Ragdolls are built at runtime, not authored
Hand-authoring 29 `PhysicalBone3D` nodes with fitted capsules into a `.tscn` is fragile and
unreadable in diffs. `scripts/player/ragdoll_builder.gd` walks the imported skeleton's rest
pose and generates the physical-bone hierarchy procedurally (capsule length/radius derived
from each bone's child offset). One code path, no scene bloat, and it survives a re-import
of `Gub.glb`.

## D-007 — The map is generated from a seed, not hand-placed
The island surface, its rocky underside, and the several hundred scattered props are
produced by a seeded generator (`scripts/world/`). Reasons: a hand-placed `.tscn` with 600
nodes is unreviewable; a seed guarantees every client builds a byte-identical map without
replicating placement; and it lets the layout be tuned by changing numbers instead of
dragging meshes. Landmarks (shrine, arch, bridges, torch ring, spawn pads) are placed
explicitly on top of the generated terrain, so the map still reads as designed rather
than as noise.
